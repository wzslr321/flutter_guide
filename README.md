## Introduction 

<p> I assume that you have already installed flutter and device/emulator configured, If not, check how to do it <a href ="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install"> here </a>

<br/>

### Before start

I really recommend to get basic knowledge in <b> Dart </b> language before before proceeding with this guide.
Trying to learn Flutter without any knowledge of the Dart lang is very common mistake, which makes it harder. 
<br/>
Here are two sites I do recommend to get started with: 
* <a target="blank" href="https://dart.dev/guides"> Official Dart site </a>
* <a target="blank" href="http://jpryan.me/dartbyexample/"> DartByExample </a> - really cool if you have experience with any other language


#

### Commands:

* `flutter create app_name` --> Creates a new flutter project, space should always be replaced with `_`
* `flutter doctor` --> Helps to diagnose issues with setup. 
* `flutter run` --> Builds an application and run it on your configured device or emulator. 
* `flutter pub get` --> Installs new packages, will be useful in <i> Packages Usage </i> section.
* `Shift + R` --> Hot restart - used in the same way as reload, fully resets application - recommended when bigger changes have been made
* `R` --> Hot reload - keyboard shortcut available in terminal when application is running, reloads the app

> Depending on what IDE you are using, the commands above may be accessible as icons, if you have flutter extension. More about it can be found <a target="blank"  href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio"> here </a> 

#

### Stateless and Stateful widgets

<br/>

<p> 
  <b> Stateless </b> widget is immutable, there is no possibility to change content of the screen unless we reload app. It is built once, and stays as it is - cannot change its state during the runtime of the app, in simple words, it can't be redrawn during the runtime.
</p>

<b> Example: </b> 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ClassNameGoesHere extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text("Hello world!");
  }
}
```

<br/>

First line `import 'package:flutter/material.dart'` is required, it gives a possibility to use Material widgets and to create Material UI design. Stateless widget returns a widget tree, more about it in the next section. 

#

  <b> Stateful </b> widget lets you display data that changes and update UI. Simplest method to do it is `setState` function, when it is triggered it acts like: <i> "Hey, something changed, rebuild is needed!". </i> It can be triggered in, for example `GestureDetector` widget.


<b> Example: </b> 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ClassNameGoesHere extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ClassNameGoesHereState createState() => _ClassNameGoesHereState();
}

class _ClassNameGoesHereState extends State<ClassNameGoesHere> {
  int count = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          count++;
        });
      },
      child: Text("$count"),
    );
  }
}
```

<br/>

  In the code above we use basic Stateful WIdget skeleton, which is always the same, so don't be scared. We declare variable count of type int, which by default is equal to 0. We display it as a child of <b> Gesture detector </b> in <b> Text </b> widget. GestureDetector lets us to use `onTap()` function where we decided to use `setState` function mentioned before. It tells the flutter *"Hey! variable count changed!"*. It notes this change and rebuilds data showing us a number increased by 1 with every tap!

<br/>

#

### How to use iOS-style widgets

<br/>

> <i> "Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase." </i>
<br/>

Although, it gives a possibility to use different widgets on Android and iOS. With usage of `dart:io` package, we are able to check, on what device app is actually running. You can find more about how to do it <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.10.4/dart-io/Platform-class.html"> here </a>.
In our code we can than use iOS style widgets <a href ="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/cupertino"> Cupertino </a>. Of course it doesn't mean that we have to check OS before every single widget, but just when we want to. 
<p>
Unfortunetely it is impossible to test an application on iOS and Android without having both MacOS and Linux/Windows, so in this guide only <i> Material </i> widgets will be shown.
</p>

***

## Widgets 

<br/>
<p align = "center"> <b> <i> Every widget's title is a reference to its official documentation, which is really great, in case when you know what you are looking for.  </i> </b> </p>
<br/>


It is worth to mention that we can use `const` before our widgets, if we are sure that it is not going to change. It will prevent app from bulding it every time, and improve a performance of our app a little bit!

<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: --> `const Text("It is not going to change, so it is working!")` 
<br/>
:x: --> `const Text("$someVariable")` Variable, as name says, can be changed, so we can't use it, <b> unless it is of type `const` also! </b>

  <i> That is only a small part of all available widgets, I encourage you to check out <a target = "blank" href="https://github.com/annshsingh/FlutterWidgetGuide"> this </a>  great repository for more useful widgets! </i>
</p>

<br/>

### We can also create our <b> Reusable Custom Widgets! </b> 
<br/>

Let's say that we have 3 exactly the same buttons in our application. The only difference is text isnide. With custom widget, we can split our code, <b> so it looks like this in those 3 spots: </b>
```dart
DefaultButtonWidgetFirst(
   textContent: "Hello world!",
)
```

<br/>

<b> Insted of this: </b>
```dart
Container(
    width: queryData.size.width * 0.5,
    height: queryData.size.height * 0.25,
    child:FlatButton(
      onPressed: () {}, // Does nothing for now, but is required
      child: Text(
        "$textContent",
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 16,
          color: Colors.cyan,
        ),
      ),
    ),
);
```
<br/>

> So... How can we do it?

<br/>

In separate file, we create Stateless or Stateful widget, stateless in this case. <br/> <br/>
Than we declare variables which it takes as arguments everytime when is used. <br/> <br/>
We use <b> final </b> variable type, because it is going to be declared only once during a runtime, and we specify its type. <br/> <br/>
<b> Example: </b> `final String textContent;` <br/> <br/>
Than, we have two ways of declaring arguments.
* <b> 1. </b> Named arguments with usage of "{}"
```dart
const DefaultButtonWidgetFirst({
   this.textContent,
});
```

<br/>

<b> this keyword </b> refers to final variable we created before.

With named arguments, we than use this widget specyfing every agument by its name. Named arguments are not required by default! Although, we can set it to required with `@required` decorator from material package, so it looks like that: 
```dart
const DefaultButtonWidgetSecond({
   @required this.textContentSecond,
});
```



* <b> 2. </b> Un-named arguments, without "{}", those are always required! 
```dart
  const DefaultButtonWidgetThird(this.textContentThird);
```

<br/>

When we use a custom widget with un-named arguments, we declare arguments <b> in sequence </b>, so un-named arguments are useful only when we deal with small amount of them, and we are sure that we will remember their sequence.

<br/>

Now we can use this widget wherever we want. <br/>
First we need to import a file with our widge on top of our file, where we want to use it, in my case : `import './widgets/custom_button.dart';`
Now we can use it in our code:
```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("My app"),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          DefaultButtonWidgetFirst(
            textContent: "Hello world!",
          ),
          DefaultButtonWidgetSecond(
            textContentSecond: "Hello world 2!",
          ),
          DefaultButtonWidgetThird('Hello world 3!')
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
<br/>

### Packages usage

#

<br/>

There are awesome packages that we can use in our code really easily and can be found <a href="https://pub.dev/"> here! </a> <br/> <br/>
<p align="center"> <b> How to use them? </b> </p>

#

Packages, fonts, images have to be specified in <b> <a href="https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec"> pubspec.yaml </a> </b> file, which containts metadata required to specify dependencies.It is very restrictive and care even about spaces.
To require dependencies we must find this part of code: 

<br/>

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
```
<br/>

Now we can declare packages we want under each other, by specyfing a name and version, which we can see on its pub.dev page. </br>
Example of <a href = "https://pub.dev/packages/http/install"> http </a> package usage.
<br/>
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.12.2
```

<br/> 
<b> Remember about right spacing! </b>

<p> In this file we can also declare other assets, like fonts and images. Examples of it are already in builded pubspec.yaml file.
<br/>
  
```yaml
fonts:
 - family: Schyler
   fonts:
     - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf // path to our font
     - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
        style: italic
```
<br/>
